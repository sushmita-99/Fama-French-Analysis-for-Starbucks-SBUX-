# Fama-French-Analysis-for-Starbucks-SBUX
**Project Description:**
This personal project focuses on calculating and analyzing the beta of Starbucks Corporation (SBUX) using the Fama-French Three-Factor Model. The analysis compares the stock performance of SBUX in two periods: **pre-pandemic (2015-2019) and during the pandemic (2020-2023)**. The project utilizes Excel to run regression analyses and interpret the coefficients of the Market Risk Premium (Mkt-RF), SMB (Size), and HML (Value vs. Growth) factors, and to analyze how these factors influenced SBUX’s stock returns during both periods.
## Key Factors Analyzed:
- **Market Risk Premium (Mkt-RF)**: Measures the excess return of the market over the risk-free rate.
- **SMB (Size)**: Captures the difference in returns between small-cap and large-cap stocks.
- **HML (Value vs. Growth)**: Represents the difference in returns between value stocks and growth stocks.

## Files:
- **Excel File**: `Fama-French-Beta-Analysis-SBUX-Pre-During-Pandemic.xlsx` – Contains regression results and coefficient analysis.

## How to Use:
1. Open the Excel file (`Fama-French-Beta-Analysis-SBUX-Pre-During-Pandemic`) to explore the data and results.
2. Open the PDF file ('Report on Results') for explanations on the results.
4. Review the regression statistics, coefficients, and analysis for both pre-pandemic and pandemic periods.

## Project Context:
This project demonstrates my ability to apply the **Fama-French Three-Factor Model** to analyze stock returns, with a specific focus on **Starbucks (SBUX)** and how market conditions influenced its performance during the pandemic.
